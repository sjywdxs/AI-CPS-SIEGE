<h1>SIEGE: A Semantics-Guided Safety Enhancement Framework for AI-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems</h1>

<div style="margin:50px; text-align: justify;">
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have been widely deployed in various industry domains to accomplish complex and safety-critical tasks, such as automotive vehicles, robotics manufacturing, and medical equipment. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its promising abilities in decision-making, prediction, and optimization, a growing number of CPSs adopt AI components in the loop to extend their functionality and reliability.

We propose SIEGE, a semantics-guided ensemble control framework for AI-CPS, which aims to construct an efficient, robust, and reliable control system for multi-tasks AI-CPSs. We utilize a semantic-based abstraction to decompose the large state space, capture the ongoing system status and predict future conditions in terms of the satisfaction of specifications.  We propose a series of new semantics-aware ensemble strategies and an end-to-end DRL hierarchical ensemble method to improve the flexibility and reliability of the control systems. Our large-scale, comprehensive evaluations over five typical CPS benchmarks show that 1) the semantics abstraction can efficiently narrow the large state space and predict the semantics of incoming states, 2) our semantics-guided methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art individual controllers and traditional ensemble methods, and 3) the DRL hierarchical ensemble approach shows promising capabilities to deliver a more robust, efficient, and safety-assured control system.
